# Phase 10B3J Goal Mode Final Report

## Outcome

BLOCKED (terminal B). The sole permitted Citation Precision repair, J1 strict claim citation pruning, was evaluated once on the full 36-question Development split with only its flag enabled. Citation Precision was 38.89%, below the required 80.00%. Under the experiment-control rule, this keeps Citation Precision as the primary blocker, so the J1 wiring was reverted and no J2--J4, Validation, final 52-question evaluation, or Candidate activation was attempted.

The first J1 request attempt had an invalid trace configuration and was discarded; it was not combined with the valid run. The valid run was complete (36/36) and used the fixed Candidate with supplemental retrieval disabled.

## Preserved baseline and safety

- Candidate: `5bca792c08fcf2f7b08cbaed09b6d525` (`g10b3c20260803`), never activated.
- Old Active and final Active: `a2d1c77ce08b414495e9d845cc42f799`.
- J0 offline certification passed its specified bounded non-regression gates.
- Lifecycle tests prove `building`, `failed`, and `deleting` generations are rejected; ordinary queries retain Active routing.
- J1 code commit `3c4a73f37db48ba60df9947b5e522d65a023b6ca` was reverted by `6a11bdb8980f379bec579e125b789ea2a28bbfa0`.

## J1 valid Development metrics

| Metric | Result | Gate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Completion / trace completeness | 36/36 (100%) | 100% |
| Supporting Citation Recall | 4/9 (44.44%) | no decline |
| Expected Answer-point Coverage | 4/39 (10.26%) | no decline |
| Citation Precision | 3.5/9 (38.89%) | >=80% |
| Overcitation | 1/9 (11.11%) | <=20% |
| Question Citation Accuracy | 3/26 (11.54%) | >=95% |
| Unsupported Answer | 18/26 (69.23%) | no increase |
| False Rejection | 10/36 (27.78%) | no worsening |
| Wrong generation / fabricated citation / unexpected 5xx | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 |

## Evidence and next dependency

- J0 metrics: `evaluation/phase10b3j_goal/j0_development_metrics.json`
- J1 metrics and result hash: `evaluation/phase10b3j_goal/j1_results.json`
- J1 result records: `evaluation/phase10b3j_goal/development_results.jsonl`
- Failure matrix: `evaluation/phase10b3j_goal/failure_matrix.json`
- Rollback proof: `evaluation/phase10b3j_goal/rollback_proof.json`

The required next dependency is an explicit human-approved expansion of the permitted citation-quality strategy boundary. No dataset, Holdout, Candidate embedding/index, retrieval settings, or Active pointer was changed.

## Final HEAD verification

- Collection: 774 tests collected.
- Focused post-rollback checks: 35 passed, 1 FastAPI deprecation warning; J0 certification script and Ruff passed.
- Full suite: 757 passed, 12 skipped, 5 failed, 2 warnings. The failures require absent local parser raw/PDF inputs, a parser mapping source mismatch, and the absent Phase 7 RC ZIP; they are not repaired because this terminal B delivery does not authorize recreating historical artifacts or packaging an RC.
- Secret scan: 136 lexical matches were reviewed as configuration identifiers, auth code, fixtures, or placeholders; `confirmed_secret_count=0`.
